Frima modifications
==================
We needed to modify the "transient" behaviour to work like Morphia does (include "public transient SomeType someField" and exclude fields with the @Transient annotation).

###Documentation

[Quick Start](https://github.com/RuedigerMoeller/fast-serialization/wiki/Serialization)

[All Pages](https://github.com/RuedigerMoeller/fast-serialization/wiki)

this project was hosted in googlecode, documentation is still not fully moved. see (http://fast-serialization.googlecode.com)

###mvn

Do not use 1.56, is has a major issue.

```.xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>de.ruedigermoeller</groupId>
    <artifactId>fst</artifactId>
    <version>1.57</version>
</dependency>
```

###how to build 

* The maven build should work out of the box and reproduces the artifact hosted on maven.org
* To use the gradle build, you need to configure the proxy server in settings.properties (or just set empty if you do not sit behind a proxy).

<b>Note</b> that instrumentation done for fst-structs works only if debug info is turned on during compile. Reason is that generating methods at runtime with javassist fails (probably a javassist bug ..). 
<b>This does not affect the serialization implementation. </b>

<b>JDK 1.6 Build</b>
https://github.com/RuedigerMoeller/fast-serialization/releases/tag/v1.55-1.6
(only serialization works for 1.6)
